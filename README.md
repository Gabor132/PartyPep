# Clone & Go

1. Clone the repo
2. Fetch the branches
3. Create project with existing sources
4. Check jdbc.properties for the DB configuration and change accordingly for DEV (IT and PROD should stay the same)
5. Setup your local DB and change the jdbc.properties
6. Add the jdbc.properties file to your .gitignore to avoid overriding
